Demo Case
For the demo, you should have 3 clients. At startup, they should all display the
following information:
Balance: $10
Then, the clients will issue transactions to each other, e.g. A gives B $4, etc.
You will need to maintain each client’s balance through the banking server and
display the order of transactions.
